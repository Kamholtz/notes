One of its children is a `vault`. When checking out the notes on iOS it isn't possible to select the `vault` folder as root, so maybe iOS could checkout a the `vault` subdirectory instead of the root of the repo.\n- [ ] Dendron front matter (e.g. id) isn't created, so need to fun `Dendron: Doctor` command within VSCode\n- [ ] Equivalent of `Dendron: Go Down` command in Obsidian\n- [x] Image links created in Dendron start with `/assets`. They do not resolve in this vault within obsidian. This is likely due to root of the vault being one directory above all of the notes and the path starting with `/` being interpreted as absolute.\n  - in contrast, obsidian creates links do not start with the slash and are thus relative\n  - Images links in Obsidian were being prefixed with `/` due to a setting in `Dendron Paste Image` called `pasteImage.prefix=\"/\"`\n    - Changing it to `pasteImage.prefix=\"\"` results in proper relative links that Obisidian is able to resolve\n","n":0.042}}},{"i":9,"$":{"0":{"v":"Dendron","n":1}}},{"i":10,"$":{"0":{"v":"Learning","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Shortcuts\n\n- [ ] Determine what is bound to `ctrl + L` which interferes with using dendron's schema lookup\n  - Vscode Neovim seems to be using keybinding.

For some reason the Intellisense dropdown dims out when pressing CTRL so it gets kind of hard to see the content in the dropdown. It's not a big problem though, since you can always release CTRL and it will light up again. I mostly use this method when I don't know the name of the method and want to browse for it.\n\nIf I know the name or part of the name it is often quicker to just type some of the letters in the method name. If I know for example that the name of the method I want is GetHashCode then I would just type \"geh\" or \"has\" or similar since that would be matched by intellisense.\n\nShare\nImprove this answer\nFollow\nedited Jul 27 '20 at 11:59\n\nfat\n4,96833 gold badges3737 silver badges6262 bronze badges\nanswered Sep 11 '13 at 14:50\n\nDoktorn\n67755 silver badges77 bronze badges\n4\nThe dimming is a usability feature they added sometime around VS 2010. Intellisense would have a nasty habit of obscuring exactly the code you wanted to look at, which meant you had to close intellisense, read the code, and then reopen intellisense. Now, with a simple Ctrl press, it turns transparant so you can quickly read your code and let go of the key again, without leaving intellisense. – Bas Sep 11 '13 at 15:02\n11\nHallelujah!! I didn't think anyone was going to solve this! Following your tip, I chose to use Alt+J and Alt+K which is closer to the J/K keys I use in Vim for up/down.

e.g.:\n\n  ```c\n  #defineZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_OCCUPANCY_SENSING_PIR_SERVER_ROLE_INIT pir_sensor_init\n  ```\n\n- The init function has to pass the write attribute hook to the stack, e.g.:\n\n  ```c\n  zb_zcl_add_cluster_handlers(ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_OCCUPANCY_SENSING_PIR,\n                                ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_SERVER_ROLE,\n                                check_value_pir_sensor_server,\n                                write_attr_pir_sensor_server_hook,\n                                (zb_zcl_cluster_handler_t)NULL);\n  ```\n\n  - Notice that in `zb_zcl_occupancy_sensing.h` these are not defined as null\n\n    ```c\n    #define ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_OCCUPANCY_SENSING_SERVER_ROLE_INIT (zb_zcl_cluster_init_t)NULL\n    #define ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_OCCUPANCY_SENSING_CLIENT_ROLE_INIT (zb_zcl_cluster_init_t)NULL\n    ```\n\n  - Further to this point has the following comment `zb_zcl_comon.h` regarding the `ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_*_SERVER_ROLE_INIT` and  `ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_*_SERVER_CLIENT_INIT` `#defines`\n\n  ```c\n  /** @brief ZCL Cluster Init Handler. This handler is called on registering device context (@ref\n      ZB_AF_REGISTER_DEVICE_CTX). Initialization of the cluster should include @ref\n      zb_zcl_add_cluster_handlers call, if any of the cluster handlers are implemented.\n\n      Cluster Init handler is bound to the cluster declaration via ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_DESC macro. Every\n      cluster should implement \"<cluster_id>_<cluster_role>_INIT\" macro, for example:\n      @code\n      #define ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_ON_OFF_SERVER_ROLE_INIT zb_zcl_on_off_init_server\n      #define ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_ON_OFF_CLIENT_ROLE_INIT zb_zcl_on_off_init_client\n      @endcode\n\n      If cluster does not have any initialization steps and does not need any cluster handlers,\n      Cluster Init handler may be NULL, for example:\n      @code\n      #define ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_OCCUPANCY_SENSING_SERVER_ROLE_INIT (zb_zcl_cluster_init_t)NULL\n      #define ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_ID_OCCUPANCY_SENSING_CLIENT_ROLE_INIT (zb_zcl_cluster_init_t)NULL\n      @endcode\n  */\n  ```\n\n  - These are called in `ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_DESC` for declaring the simple descriptor (`zboss_api_af.h`). See `cluster_id##_SERVER_ROLE_INIT` within the macro\n\n    ```c\n    #define ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_DESC(cluster_id, attr_count, attr_desc_list, cluster_role_mask, manuf_code)         \\c\n    {                                                                                                          \\c\n      (cluster_id),                                                                                            \\c\n      (attr_count),                                                                                            \\c\n      (attr_desc_list),                                                                                        \\c\n      (cluster_role_mask),                                                                                     \\c\n      (manuf_code),                                                                                            \\c\n      (((cluster_role_mask) == ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_SERVER_ROLE) ? cluster_id##_SERVER_ROLE_INIT : \\c\n       (((cluster_role_mask) == ZB_ZCL_CLUSTER_CLIENT_ROLE) ? cluster_id##_CLIENT_ROLE_INIT : NULL)) \\c\n    }\n    ```\n\n## SET_ATTR_DESCR_WITH macro\n\nUse of `ZB_SET_ATTR_DESCR_WITH_xxx` `#define`s found...\n\n- `zb_zcl_common.h`\n\n  ```c\n  #define ZB_ZCL_SET_ATTR_DESC(attr_id, data_ptr) ZB_SET_ATTR_DESCR_WITH_##attr_id(data_ptr),\n  ```\n\n## Home Assistant recognising previous devices appearing with different names\n\nI would have thought this device record would have been deleted\n\n> [0x6093](Dimable_Light_v0.2): completed configuration\n> [0x6093](Dimable_Light_v0.2): stored in registry: ZhaDeviceEntry(name='Nordic Dimable_Light_v0.1', ieee='f4:ce:36:71:26:ac:67:47', last_seen=1645960862.7940586)\n\n## Device Signature Comparison with Philips Device\n\n[[Device Signature|proj.zb-home-automation.occupancy-sensing.device-signature]]\n\n### Occupancy Attribute Reporting appears in Home Assistant!\n\nHave confirmed that occupancy attribute reporting works on first connection\n\n- Commit: [Report occupancy on initialization (just like level and on off) · Kamholtz/zb-lightbulb@0ce322e](https://github.com/Kamholtz/zb-lightbulb/commit/0ce322e55144da43b0584d4284d5edf9fedc2236)\n\n| Test | Success Criteria | Success? |\n| ---- | ------ | --- |\n| Reboot via push button | Device reconnects | `true` |\n| Reboot via removing power cable | Device reconnects | `true` |\n","n":0.048}}},{"i":75,"$":{"0":{"v":"Device Signature","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n## Objective\n\nPerform a comparison between the Philips occupancy sensor and my device.\n\n## Results\n\n- [x] Have been able to rule out that device signature being incorrect.

However, the coordinator is a legacy device (stack revision of R20 or earlier), and does not support TC link key exchange. The same is true for the Sonoff SNZB-02, which is why it is able to join the network successfully.\n>\n> One possible solution is to use zb_bdb_set_legacy_device_support(1) to enable legacy support on the nRF52840. Be aware that we do not recommend setting this on router devices, as it will disable TC link key exchange and will make it so the device is not compliant with Zigbee R21 or later. This is a workaround, and the cleanest solution would be to have a coordinator that is a certified R21 or R22 Zigbee device with support for TC link key exchange.\n\n\n![](assets/images/2022-02-05-17-38-51.png)\n\n[Zigbee router leaves network autonomously after few seconds - Nordic Q&amp;A - Nordic DevZone - Nordic DevZone](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/83640/zigbee-router-leaves-network-autonomously-after-few-seconds)\n\n## Configuring Zigbee samples to work with other ecosystems\n\n![[Permanent SDK changes|ee.nrf-connect-sdk#permanent-sdk-changes]]\n\n> Zigbee samples in nRF Connect SDK use the centralized type of Zigbee network\n\n- Zigbee Coordinator acts as Trust Center\n  - Only the Trust Center can issue encryption keys + allow [[ee.zb.router]]s and [[ee.zb.end-device]]s into the network\n\n> If you are connecting a Nordic Semiconductor’s device programmed with a Zigbee sample to a third-party Zigbee Coordinator, set the CONFIG_ZIGBEE_CHANNEL_SELECTION_MODE_MULTI Kconfig option for the Zigbee sample in nRF Connect SDK.
