<p>But by far the simplest solution is to use a newer feature of ECMAScript, a function method called <code>bind</code>. It is explained well here, including the fact that it is not supported by all browsers. That's why a lot of libraries, like jQuery, Prototype, etc., have cross-browser function-binding utility methods like $.proxy.</p>
