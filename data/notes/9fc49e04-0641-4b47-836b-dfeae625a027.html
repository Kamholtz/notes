<p><a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/2392">what 's the reason ? LSP :: one.py not in project or it is blacklisted. · Issue #2392 · emacs-lsp/lsp-mode</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You probably pressed "Esc" when the "LSP import project" prompt came, unless you blacklisted it explicitly using lsp-blacklist-project (which is unlikely).</p>
<p>All you need to do to fix this is to press M-x lsp followed by i, with one.py as the current buffer.</p>
