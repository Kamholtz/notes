[How am I supposed to user vim-plug with Windows - PowerShell? · Issue #633 · junegunn/vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/issues/633)


> Neovim doesn't load files in ~\vimfiles\autoload, the installation instruction for Windows was written when Neovim didn't officially support Windows. I suppose plug.vim should be placed under ~\AppData\Local\nvim\autoload. @justinmk, can you confirm this?

e.g.

```vim
call plug#begin('~/AppData/Local/nvim/autoload')
```
