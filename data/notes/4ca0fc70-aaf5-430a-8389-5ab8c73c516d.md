## Adjust volume for teams

[r/MicrosoftTeams - Ridiculously high volume with AirPods on Teams (Windows 10)?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gseyiw/ridiculously_high_volume_with_airpods_on_teams/)

> I found a way to turn the sound down on Windows. When you're on the Teams call, go into System > Sound > Advanced sound options (App volume and device preferences). You can then adjust the Teams volume slider.
