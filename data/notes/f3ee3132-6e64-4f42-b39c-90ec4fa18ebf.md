## Troubleshooting

### Reboot job runs but nothing happens



It seems that if the output is not redirected somewhere then cronjob does not run. However this may have also been fixed by installing [[os.linux.cli.postfix]]




```sh
@reboot /home/pi/repos/presence-detector-cljs-deploy/start.sh 1> /home/pi/repos/presence-detector-cljs-deploy/cron-out 2> /home/pi/repos/presence-detector-cljs-deploy/cron-err
```

#### Redirecting stdout and stderr within cron


- `1>` is stdout
- `2>` is stderr

In the context of `@reboot` within crontab, the first part indicating time intervals can be ignored.

`33 3 * * * /path/to/some_job.sh 1> /dev/null 2> /other/path/to/some_job.err`

#### Installing postfix

`sudo apt-get install postfix`
