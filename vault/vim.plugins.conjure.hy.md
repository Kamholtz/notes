Plugin to recognise hy filetypes is needed for conjure to detect hy files:

[GitHub - hylang/vim-hy: Vim files and plugins for Hy](https://github.com/hylang/vim-hy)

- Install the python neovim client `pip3 install pynvim` (or just `pip` if `python` itself is aliased to `python3`)
- Check that hy is installed with `:python import hy`
- Make sure python scripts are available from path `C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python310\Scripts\` as that is where `hy.exe` is located
