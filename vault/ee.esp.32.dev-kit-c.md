## Power consumption

[Insight Into ESP32 Sleep Modes &amp; Their Power Consumption](https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp32-sleep-modes-power-consumption/)

### Active mode

> As the active mode keeps everything (especially the WiFi module, the Processing Cores and the Bluetooth module) ON at all times, the chip requires more than 240mA current to operate. Also we observed that if you use both WiFi and Bluetooth functions together, sometimes high power spikes appear (**biggest was 790mA**).
