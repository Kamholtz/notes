## ToDo

- [ ] How to prevent [[vim.plugins.project-nvim]] from throwing errors on finding root when opening a diff/fugitive buffer [GitHub - ahmedkhalf/project.nvim: The superior project management solution for neovim.](https://github.com/ahmedkhalf/project.nvim)

- [x] Open in Visual Studio from NVIM
  - Change file saving to use `aniseed.spit` instead of `:!` command

  - [ ] Try using vim dispatch or plenary to asyncronously open things in VS [GitHub - tpope/vim-dispatch: dispatch.vim: Asynchronous build and test dispatcher](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch)
    - Could not get plenary to work, but plain [[Loop Uv|vim.loop-uv]] was possible (but more verbose and fiddly)

- Determine why this happens with [[vim.plugins.vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people]] [barfage and slurpage not working · Issue #6 · tpope/vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people/issues/6)

- [ ] Try replacing auto-session with [GitHub - jedrzejboczar/possession.nvim: Flexible session management for Neovim.](https://github.com/jedrzejboczar/possession.nvim)

- A way to set cursor position on commandline [VIM set cursor position in Command Line](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13511084/vim-set-cursor-position-in-command-line)
