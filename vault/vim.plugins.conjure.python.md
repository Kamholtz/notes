A python client does not exist yet. I tried implementing one using the [[vim.plugins.conjure.hy]] client as a base but have not had success.

The major issue I encountered is that the python process spawned does not seem response. [Search results for uv.spawn("python"...)](https://github.com/search?q=uv.spawn%28%22python%22%29&type=code) are very siilar to what is done in Conjure.

Some relevant information:
