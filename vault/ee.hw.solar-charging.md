## Power Path using a P-channel MOSFET

[[ee.hw.tp4056]] and [[ee.hw.dw01A]] with power path using [[ee.hw.fqp27p06]].

- Solar panel voltage present results in power supplied to MCU via solar panel only + battery continues charging

  - > Anything that lists 1) powerpath, 2) Vsys output, or 3) uses an external current sense resistor should work fine - so BQ25606, CN3791, STNS01 (if your phone's current draw is unusually low), but not TP4056 or MCP738xx.

    - [[ee.hw.cn3791-solar-mppt-approx-charger]] (for solar with MPPT approximation)
    - [[ee.hw.bq25606-buck-lipo-battery-charger]] (not specifically for solar or MPPT like)
    - [[ee.hw.stns01-li-ion-linear-battery-charger-with-ldo]] - Package and LDO make it unsuitable for my needs as the [[ee.nrf52840]] has an inbuilt DC converter so regulating twice would be inefficient

    - Although [[ee.hw.tp4056]] and [[ee.hw.mcp73837-li-ion-battery-charger]] do not have an external current sense resistor, a power path can be created used the application not for the MCP73837 mentioned in [[Power Path using a P-channel MOSFET|ee.hw.solar-charging#power-path-using-a-p-channel-mosfet]]

  - > The reason for these precautions is that lithum-ion batteries do not like being float-charged (held at 4.2v while current asymptotes to zero) as it causes them to grow dendrites and stab themselves to a fiery death.
